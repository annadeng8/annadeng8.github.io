        <!-- TODO: Add link to photo -->
        <p>Hi, my name is Anna! I'm a high schooler from California who loves thinking about math, computers, anything STEM,
and how we can make the world a better place. I'm also an avid figure skating competitor and fan. In my free time
I like to read, crochet, discover new things, and talk to people!</p>
