Yay! I finally set up my site using Jekyll to integrate a blog in. It is well-known that one of the best ways to retain information is to teach it, and one of the ways to do so is through maintaining a blog. Thus, I hope to be able to share this blog with interesting tidbits I stumble across. I may also blog about my life; I've also kept an informal blog since 7th grade, and blogging is so much fun! 

I guess in this first post I will discuss the future. I'm fortunate enough to have identified the fields that I obsess over and will collect [bus tickets](https://www.paulgraham.com/genius.html) for. Since middle school, I've been drawn to computer science and mathematics. The beautiful properties of numbers and the powerful nature of computers always inspired me to learn more about the subjects.

Career-wise however, I'm not too sure. My kindergarten dream was to become a teacher because I wanted to make sure every student walked home with hands full of sparkly cute stickers. I took up volunteering because a friend's mom suggested to, and I found that I enjoyed it so much, whether it be teaching little kids how to fold a paper lantern at the library or cleaning up a garden; little things that brought smiles to others' faces gave myself so much joy. That's why I also always include in my introductions how I want to do something that will benefit the world. 

I'm not too sure how I can find the intersection of these three desires, though I can say I've been making "progress" towards them depending on what you think "benefiting the world" should encompass. Conducting research in the aesthetics of pure math or the abilities of LLMs has some impact, but there are a lot of important problems in the world that I want to help fix, like improving education and mitigating the harmful effects of climate change. Anyways, I'll keep on exploring everything I can through a combination of BFS (breadth) and DFS (depth), and I'll update everyone along the way. <3
