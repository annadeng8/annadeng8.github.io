Hi, my name is Anna!

<img src="images\profilepic.png" alt="AnnaDeng" width="200" class="center"/>

I'm a high school senior (grade 12 student) from California who loves thinking and learning. I am very interested in mathematics, computers, physics, and really anything to help with making the world a better place.  Check out my resume, my project page, or my blog to see what I'm working on. Right now, I am getting into research regarding LLM, interpretability, and applied ML, along with factorization theory in commutative algebra. I'm also a mathlete who has competed in national olympiads. Please reach out to me if you would like to work with me!

In my free time, I enjoy reading, discovering, trying out new things, listening to music, language-learning, exploring nature, and talking! I am also a competitive figure skater and love the sport so much.
