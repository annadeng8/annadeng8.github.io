Hi, my name is Anna!

<img src="images\profilepic.png" alt="AnnaDeng" width="200" class="center"/>

I'm a high school junior from California who loves thinking and learning. I am very interested in mathematics, computers, and really anything to help with making the world a better place. I'm also a competitive figure skater and love the sport so much. In my free time, I enjoy reading, discovering, trying out new things, listening to music, language-learning, exploring nature, and talking! Check out my resume, my project page, or my blog to see what I'm working on. Right now, I am getting into research regarding LLMs and applied ML, along with factorization theory in commutative algebra. Please reach out to me if you would like to work with me!
